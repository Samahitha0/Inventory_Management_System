# Inventory_Management_System
IOT based inventory Management System using RFID Reader and cards
An Arduino-based RFID inventory management system that utilizes Wi-Fi for communication and ensures secure data transfer.
Machine learning algorithm to predict the quantity sold on a particular day
## Overview

This project implements an RFID inventory management system using Arduino (NodeMCU), allowing for real-time tracking of product quantities. The system leverages Wi-Fi for communication and includes a secure data transfer mechanism using HTTPS.

## Features

- RFID tag scanning for product identification
- Wi-Fi connectivity for communication
- Secure communication using HTTPS
- Real-time inventory updates
- Low quantity alerts with push notifications
- Machine learning algorithm to predict
- Simple hash function applied to send rfid reading to thingspeak

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- Necessary Arduino libraries (ESP8266WiFi, MFRC522, etc.)
- Access to a secure server with HTTPS support
Usage
Connect the RFID reader and NodeMCU to your Arduino board.

Power up the system and wait for it to connect to Wi-Fi.

Scan RFID tags to update inventory and trigger low quantity alerts.

Monitor the serial output for system updates and alerts.
